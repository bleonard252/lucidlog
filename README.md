LucidLog Dream Journal is a dream journal app that starts simple, then you can turn on optional features to make the app more powerful!

This app is currently only available in English.

Basic features include:
+ The "New Entry" button to journal a new dream.
+ The "Tag Dream" (hash-tag) button to "tag" a dream to journal it later.
+ Add titles to journal entries to help you remember them.
+ Several date/time formats to choose from.
+ A simple switch to distinguish lucid dreams from non-lucid dreams. Turning on this switch will turn the cloud icon in the list to purple.
+ A simple switch to mark low recall, so that you can still journal if you don't remember anything.
+ Import, export, and burn your journal.
+ Samsung DeX support. (Desktop Mode not tested)

Optional features include:
+ WILD Distinction: Gives WILDs special markings, including colors and an icon.
+ Remember Techniques: Adds a list in the editor for configurable techniques.
+ Counters: Adds counters to the dream detail screen. This will count your dreams, lucids, and in coordination with WILD Distinction, WILDs.
+ Group by Night: Adds a header to the most recent dream of each night, showing what night you had some dreams on. This is useful when you have high recall.
